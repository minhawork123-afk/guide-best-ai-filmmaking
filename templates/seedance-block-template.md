BLOCK [N] — [START TIME]–[END TIME] — [BEAT NAME]

@Image1 = [Character 1 — one-line description: name, key physical detail, wardrobe]
@Image2 = [Character 2 — one-line description, if present]
@Image3 = [Location — one-line description: space, time of day, key lighting]
@Image4 = [Final frame of Block [N-1] — BLOCKS 2+ ONLY. Omit for Block 1.]

In each character sheet, take the face from the [LEFT / chest-up portrait] panel.
The centre panel omits the head deliberately.
[CHARACTER NAME(S)] [has / have] a head and face in every shot of this film.

Continuous scene. [No dialogue / Voiceover only / Dialogue on camera].
[Weather condition]. [Time of day].
[LEFT/RIGHT physical facts for this block:
"The wound is on the LEFT arm. The gun is in the RIGHT hand.
The tattoo is on the inside of the LEFT wrist."]

0–[X]s: [Camera position and movement — be specific: "Handheld wide shot, 32mm
anamorphic, camera low at ankle height, pushing in very slowly."]
[@Image number] [exact physical action — what a camera would see, never interior states].
[Atmosphere detail — rain on leaf litter / chalk dust hanging in the light / etc.]
Audio: [Specific sounds — not "ambient sound" but named real sounds with timing:
"rain on foliage, a low roll of thunder at 4s, boots dragging through wet mud"]

[X]–[Y]s: Cut. [Camera]. [@Image subject]. [Action]. [Atmosphere].
Audio: [Specific sounds]

[Y]–[Z]s: Cut. [Camera]. [@Image subject]. [Action]. [Atmosphere].
Audio: [Specific sounds]

[Continue for all shots. Durations must total the block length exactly.]

Style DNA Templates
Write your Style DNA once per project. Paste it byte-identical at the end of every block — never reword it.
Cinematic Film — Dark / Atmospheric
```
Style DNA:
Shot on ARRI Alexa 35 with anamorphic prime lenses. Handheld with subtle
micro-shake. Photoreal live-action cinematography, no stylisation.
Flat overcast key light, cold blue-grey ambience, deep crushed blacks,
desaturated teal-green palette. Heavy continuous rain, volumetric mist between
trunks, water beading on the lens. 24fps, 180-degree shutter, fine 35mm grain,
shallow depth of field. Bleak, hopeless, oppressive.
```
AI Persona / UGC — Phone-shot Realism
```
Style DNA:
Shot on a recent smartphone. HDR, mild digital over-sharpening on edges,
visible luminance noise in dim areas, slight rolling shutter on pans,
clipped highlights near windows. Flat and ungraded. Genuine handheld feel
throughout — natural human hand tremor, small organic drifts and micro-adjustments,
slightly crooked horizons. Never a tripod, never a gimbal, never slow motion.
Real room tone. No music. No film grain, no halation, no cinematic grade.
```
Cinematic Car / Product — Clean Industrial
```
Style DNA:
Shot on ARRI Alexa 35 with spherical prime lenses. Smooth controlled dolly
movement. Photoreal live-action cinematography, no stylisation.
Hard directional key light from camera-right, cool blue-grey fill,
deep blacks, desaturated steel and graphite palette. 24fps, 180-degree shutter,
fine 35mm grain, shallow depth of field on inserts, deep focus on wides. Cold, precise, controlled.

Craft Rules — Apply to Every Block
Camera first in every shot description.
Then subject. Then action. Then atmosphere. Early tokens carry more weight.
Physical actions only. Never interior states.
❌ `she is nervous`
✅ `her jaw tightens, she doesn't blink, her hand is still`
Sustained poses need a duration.
❌ `he aims the gun`
✅ `he holds the aim for the full three seconds and does not lower the arm`
Involuntary motion needs a mechanism.
❌ `he drops it`
✅ `his hand goes limp, the fingers uncurl, it slips from a slack grip`
Name the wrong version inline when a mistake is likely.
`the weapon slips free — he does not open his hand, does not throw it`
State left/right as hard facts. Capitalise the side.
`the wound is on the LEFT arm` — models mirror reference images constantly.
Dialogue and physical action never overlap.
She speaks, or she moves. Never both at the same time.
Refer to characters by @image number inside block prompts.
`@Image1 sits slumped against the boulder` — not the character's name.
Character names are for the shot list, where you are reading, not the model.

Common Mistakes and Fixes
Mistake	Fix
Face changes between blocks	Never change @image upload order. Add @Image4 (last frame of previous block) from block 2 onward.
Video looks like a 3D render	Add: "this must read as actual footage shot on a real camera, NOT a digital render, NOT a 3D visualisation, NOT a video-game environment"
Character doing two things at once	Separate into two shots. Dialogue and action never overlap.
Skin looks plastic	Run the skin realism pass on the character sheet before generating
Shot durations don't add up	Count every shot's seconds. They must total the block length exactly.
Location looks different between blocks	Always attach the same @Image3 location plate to every block
Block too long	Target 12–20 seconds. Hard ceiling is 30 seconds. Split at a story beat.
Shot under 2 seconds	Combine with adjacent shot or extend to 3 seconds minimum
